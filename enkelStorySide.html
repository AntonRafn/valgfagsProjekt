            <h1>The First Sauce I Burned</h1>

          <p>
            I still remember the smell. A mix of cream, butter, and something
            just slightly bitter — the unmistakable scent of a sauce gone wrong.
            It was my very first week in a professional kitchen, and I had been
            given the simplest task on the line: watch the béchamel. Just stir,
            keep the heat steady, and don’t let it catch.
          </p>
          <p>How hard could that be?</p>
          <p>Turns out, harder than I thought.</p>
          <p>
            The dinner rush was in full swing, and I wanted to prove myself
            useful. One of the senior chefs asked me to grab herbs, another
            called for plates, and in my eagerness to show I could keep up, I
            left the pan for what I told myself would only be ten seconds. Ten
            seconds in a busy kitchen is like a lifetime. By the time I
            returned, the bottom of the pan had turned a deep golden brown — not
            the kind you brag about. I stirred in panic, but it was too late.
            The sauce had a smoky bitterness that couldn’t be saved.
          </p>
          <p>
            I thought I’d ruined the night. But to my surprise, the head chef
            didn’t yell. He just looked at the pan, then at me, and said with a
            grin:
          </p>
          <p>“Congratulations. You’ve joined the club.”</p>
          <p>
            Apparently, every chef has a first-burned sauce story. It’s almost
            like a rite of passage. That day I learned two things that have
            stayed with me ever since:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Respect the basics. No task is too small in a kitchen. Sometimes,
              it’s the “simple” jobs that demand the most attention.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mistakes are part of the recipe. You can’t be afraid of failing.
              Every burned sauce, overcooked steak, or collapsed soufflé is just
              another step toward mastering the craft.
            </li>
          </ol>
          Now, years later, I still smile whenever I smell that faint bitterness
          of something catching on the stove. It doesn’t make me panic anymore —
          it makes me grateful. Because that first sauce I burned taught me more
          than any recipe ever could.
